# Pacific Connectivity 2050

  
A data-driven web visualization built for the **Pacific DataViz Challenge 2025** â€” showcasing technology access, digital skills, and connectivity across Pacific Island nations in line with the **Blue Pacific 2050 Strategy**.


## 2025 Data Visualisation Theme


**Blue Pacific 2050 â€“ Technology and Connectivity**


This app visualizes how Pacific Island countries are advancing (or falling behind) in areas such as:

- Mobile phone ownership

- Internet usage

- Broadband penetration

- 4G network coverage

- Cybersecurity readiness

- Digital literacy

  

These insights help highlight key disparities and opportunities for regional collaboration and investment by 2050.
